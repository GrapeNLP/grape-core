This is the first version uploaded to GitHub. It is operative, though documentation is still lacking. Debug and release versions can be compiled using the script at build/scripts/build.sh. Compilation has been tested in Ubuntu and Alpine, and interfaces for Python and Java have also been developed (see modules pygrapenlp and jgrapenlp).
