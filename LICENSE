## Third-party code

This library borrows a few source code files from the Unitex project (see
https://unitexgramlab.org/) for the management of Unicode characters. These files
can be distinguished by their headers, and are also licensed under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1

This project uses the CMake script UseDoxygen.cmake to generate the project
documentation. This script is licensed under the BSD License 2.0.

The GrapeNLP group uses Boost-for-Android in order to compile the Boost C++ Libraries
for the Android platform, which are later used to build the Android version of GRAPENLP.
Boost-for-Android is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, though it is not a part
of GRAPENLP; the GrapeNLP has forked the Boost-for-Android repository for convenience.
The original repository URL is https://github.com/moritz-wundke/Boost-for-Android.
